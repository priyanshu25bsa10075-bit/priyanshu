::  Library Management System


This project is a simple Library Management System written in Python. It helps a user to manage books in a library, including displaying available books, lending books, adding new books, and returning borrowed books.

Features
•	Display the list of available books
•	Lend a book to a user and track who has borrowed it
•	Add new books to the library
•	Return a borrowed book

Usage
1.	Run the script in a Python environment.
2.	Follow the on-screen menu to choose actions:
o	Display Books
o	Lend a Book
o	Add a Book
o	Return a Book
3.	After performing an action, you can choose to continue or quit.
   
How the Code Works
•	The code uses a Library class to manage the books and their lending status.
•	Book data is stored in a list and lending information is handled with a dictionary.
•	User input is taken to perform all actions.
Requirements
•	Python 3.x
Getting Started
•	Simply copy the code into a Python file, e.g., library.py.
•	Run with python library.py.

Project Title: Library Management System
Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts by solving the library management problem. The system allows users to display, add, lend, and return books.
Technologies Used
•	Python 3.x
Code Structure
•	Library class: Handles all core functionality — storing, lending, adding, and returning books.
•	Main code uses a simple text-based menu for interaction.
Key Functions
•	displayBooks(): Shows the list of available books in the library.
•	lendBook(user, book): Allows a user to borrow a book if available.
•	addBook(book): Allows the addition of new books to the system.
•	returnBook(book): Updates the system when a book is returned.
How to Use
•	Run the Python script.
•	Choose from the options in the menu to interact with the system.
Conclusion
This project covers basics of classes/objects, using lists and dictionaries, as well as user input handling in Python. It serves as a practical exercise in building a simple management system using object-oriented programming.
